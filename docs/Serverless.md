# Serverless

Serverless is a framework to facilitate the deployment of AWS Lamda.  
By code you can define the functions, the events (those trigger the functions), the resources.

### GitHub Action step _serverless/github-action_
```yaml
# in jobs steps
    - name: Serverless deploy
      uses: serverless/github-action@master
      with: 
        args: deploy
      env: 
        AWS_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY }}
```

On GitHub it uses a special step: _serverless/github-action@master_  
GitHub action find out the action needs some package and install it. 
"Build serverless/github-action@master"   
It executes some npm install steps and then ``prebuild-install || node-gyp rebuild``
It fails with this error: "gyp WARN EACCES current user ("nobody") does not have permission to access the dev dir "/root/.cache/node-gyp/14.17.0" but it continue with some other commands and in the end Serverless Framework is installed successfully.  

### GitHub Action step _aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials_

I copied this from another online example:

```yaml
# in jobs steps
    - name: Configure AWS credentials
      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
      with: 
        aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY }}
        aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET }}
        aws-region: eu-central-1
```

What is the Access Key and its Secret ?  
Simply the Access Key and Secret Access Key of an AWS user.  
If missing it fails with "The security token included in the request is invalid." if there is no user set with the access key.  

In AWS IAM create a new user (example: "github-learning").  
Add it to a group (example "github-learning") with this policies:
- AWSLambda_FullAccess
- IAMFullAccess   WHY ???
- CloudWatchLogsFullAccess 
- AWSLambdaRole   WHY ???
- AWSCloudFormationFullAccess: it is the actual deployment of the Lambda function
- AmazonS3FullAccess: CloudFront "create Stack" step needs to create an S3 bucket

It failed on CloudFront "create Stack" step:
> Serverless: Creating Stack...
> Serverless: Checking Stack create progress...
> An error occurred: ServerlessDeploymentBucket - API: s3:CreateBucket Access Denied.

So it needs permisisons to create an S3 bucket.  

_serverless.yml_
```yaml
provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: python3.8 
  stage: test
  region: eu-central-1
```

_2021-06-14_
_python3.9_ still not supported, _dotnetcore2.1_ is the only dotnet supported.

## Packaging
https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/packaging/

By default it copy everything in the root folder (apart fro predefined ignored files).  
I tried to use "patterns" to exclude what is not meant to be packaged but it didn't worked.
```yaml
package:
  patterns:
    - "!**"
    - "src/**"
```

```yaml
package:
  individually: true
```
