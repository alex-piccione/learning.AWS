# API Gateway

When I was going to create a Gateway API I was asked to choose between
- HTTP API
- WebSocket API
- REST API
- REST API (private)

I'm not sure what is the difference between HTTP API and REST API. 

## HTTP API
Build low-latency and cost-effective REST APIs with built-in features such as OIDC and OAuth2, and native CORS support.
Works with the following:
Lambda, HTTP backends

## REST API
Develop a REST API where you gain complete control over the request and response along with API management capabilities.
Works with the following:
Lambda, HTTP, AWS Services
